	abstract = {In recent years, the ﬁeld of combinatorial optimization has witnessed a true tsunami of “novel” metaheuristic methods, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the ﬂow of water, musicians playing together – it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientiﬁc rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justiﬁcation for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics ﬁeld to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the ﬁeld of metaheuristics.},

Computational tests show that the implementation is highly effective. It has found optimal solutions for all solved problem instances we have been able to obtain, including a 7397-city problem (the largest nontrivial problem instance solved to optimality today). Furthermore, the algorithm has improved the best known solutions for a series of large-scale problems with unknown optima, among these an 85900-city problem.},

	abstract = {Simulated annealing is a well-studied local search metaheuristic used to address discrete and, to a lesser extent, continuous optimization problems. The key feature of simulated annealing is that it provides a mechanism to escape local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves (i.e., moves which worsen the objective function value) in hopes of ﬁnding a global optimum. A brief history of simulated annealing is presented, including a review of its application to discrete, continuous, and multiobjective optimization problems. Asymptotic convergence and ﬁnite-time performance theory for simulated annealing are reviewed. Other local search algorithms are discussed in terms of their relationship to simulated annealing. The chapter also presents practical guidelines for the implementation of simulated annealing in terms of cooling schedules, neighborhood functions, and appropriate applications.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the ﬁeld of combinatorial optimization has witnessed a true tsunami of “novel” metaheuristic methods, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the ﬂow of water, musicians playing together – it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientiﬁc rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justiﬁcation for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics ﬁeld to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the ﬁeld of metaheuristics.},

	abstract = {Simulated annealing is a probabilistic method proposed in Kirkpatrick, Gelett and Vecchi (1983) and Cerny (1985) for finding the global minimum of a cost function that may possess several local minima. It works by emulating the physical process whereby a solid is slowly cooled so that when eventually its structure is "frozen," this happens at a minimum energy configuration. We restrict ourselves to the case of a cost function defined on a finite set. Extensions of simulated annealing to the case of functions defined on continuous sets have also been introduced in the literature (e.g., Geman and Hwang, 1986; Gidas, 1985a; Holley, Kusuoka and Stroock, 1989; Jeng and Woods, 1990; Kushner, 1985). Our goal in this review is to describe the method, its convergence and its behavior in applications.},
